  "description": "If you type `cal` into your terminal, you will see an output of the current month in calendar form. Type `cal` and just a year, you'll see a whole year. Type `cal` plus a month and any year from 0 to 9999, and you'll see that month's calendar. It's pretty cool. Guess what? You can build a clone of `cal` right now.",
